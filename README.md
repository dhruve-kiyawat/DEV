“An improvised way of tackling the issue of creating a consistent supply chain to augment the use of Biofuels”
- Team HackStone


## Problem Statement : -

India has been a major importer of crude oil. In the year 2019-20 the import bill was around $100 billion which is a huge strain on the country’s exchequer. One possible solution to this is the augmented use of alternative fuels is the use of biofuels. Since the production of biofuels is abundant in India and it requires minimal infrastructure changes for large scale adoption, it can serve as a much easier solution to the issue. But the creation of a supply chain for regular use of Biofuels is still in its nascent stage. 

## Solution : -
We would be providing a solution for this by creating a chain between farmers(Suppliers) and Biofuel companies to provide a seamless flow of bio waste. We will create a portal for farmers where they will be able to create their own profile containing details such as their farm area, bio waste generated every week, different waste they collect like animal waste, crop waste, etc. 

It would be a user friendly portal allowing each and every farmer to easily access and contribute. The farmers will get the right price and it would act as an ecommerce platform for them. Different Companies that are working on biofuel will be able to get the information for their supplies and then it will form an endless cycle and it will benefit both the farmer and the organization.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
